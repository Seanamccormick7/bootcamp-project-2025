        <p>
          A static page is just HTML and CSS, but a dynamic page reacts to data
          and user input. The browser exposes the Document Object Model (DOM)—a
          tree of nodes you can create, update, and remove with JavaScript. By
          selecting a container, building elements with
          <code>document.createElement</code>, setting attributes, and appending
          them to the page, you can render lists, cards, and interactive UI
          without any frameworks.
        </p>
        <p>
          Interactivity comes from events. Add listeners for clicks, input
          changes, or form submissions, and update the DOM in response. Keep a
          simple “state” in memory (like an array of items) and re-render
          sections that change. Small patterns go a long way: clear containers
          before re-rendering, batch DOM writes to minimize layout thrash, and
          keep rendering logic in one place so it's easy to reason about.
        </p>
        <p>
          As your UI grows, be mindful of accessibility and performance. Prefer
          semantic elements, connect labels to inputs, and ensure keyboard focus
          flows logically. For speed, lazy-load images, debounce input handlers,
          and avoid unnecessary reflows. These habits map directly to modern
          frameworks, which automate much of this plumbing. Learning raw DOM
          first gives you a foundation that makes React, Vue, or Angular feel
          intuitive rather than magical.
